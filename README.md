# IT System and Network Provision 

## Project
* This project involves deploying the application across different environments such as VirtualBox, Docker, or AWS. The primary emphasis is on automating the provisioning of the application using Ansible and Vagrant scripts. The default configuration is established automatically without the need for manual intervention on the platform. 
* Manual configuration serves as the verification of the proper functionality of all settings across each service, including the frontend, backend, and database.
